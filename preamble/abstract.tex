\chapter*{Abstract} 

Battery life of autonomous robots is vital to certain operations such as bomb
disposal or search and rescue. The longer a robot in those scenarios can operate,
the more likely it will be for them to potentially save lives. This project aims
to implement a tool that compares existing pathfinding algorithms and adds
additional evaluation metrics such as the expected energy cost of the selected
path, as well as the amount of memory required to run the algorithm. By comparing
the pathfinding algorithms with extra evaluation metrics, it should be possible to
obtain a more readily-applicable analysis of which algorithm will work best for a
specified environment type and/or a specified robot type. On top of the comparison
tool, this project will also implement a modified version of the A* algorithm that
will natively factor in energy cost when deciding on the optimal route for a robot
to take. This new algorithm will then be compared with the existing algorithms
using the tool created in this project.
