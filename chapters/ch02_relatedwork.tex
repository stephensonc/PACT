\chapter{Related Work} 
\label{ch:relatedwork}

This chapter should include a broad and detailed review of relevant existing work. The literature review should provide background and context for the thesis work. The subsections may be organized in whatever
manner seems best suited to the material---chronological, or by topic, or
according to some other criteria (e.g., primary versus secondary resources).
